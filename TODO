- Refactor:
	- Step 1: Refactor code to use Integrator for rendering
	  and ray tracing
	- Step 2: Refactor code to use Tracer for ray tracing
	- Step 3: Refactor code to use Renderer to manage rendering

//- Sphere primitive
- Triangle primitive

- Make min_t/max_t ray updating the responsibility of the Tracer, not the primitives

- Two-stage ray tracing, similar to the Rayes (not Reyes) paper

- Simple scene-description format

- Light sources with direct lighting

- Simple material system (for testing purposes
  only, eventually replace with OSL)

- Refactor TimeBox template to use class methods for interpolation

- Multi-threaded rendering

- OSL integration

- More compact and/or faster BVH:
	- Quantized BVH?
	- MSBVH?
	- QuadBVH?
