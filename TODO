- Switch to pixel filtering by importance sampling, as in the paper
  "Filter Importance Sampling" by Ernst et al.

- Add unit tests for the disk cache class

- Triangle primitive

- Make min_t/max_t ray updating the responsibility of the Tracer, not the primitives

- Two-stage ray tracing, similar to the Rayes (not Reyes) paper
	- Create "Instance" class
	- Modify Scene class so that only instances can be stored directly
	  in the scene-level BVH.
	- Implement an alternative BVH traversal which can be resumed for a ray.
	  May require modifying rays to be traversal-aware.
	- Implement BVH method to return "next n leaf node hits".
	- Change Tracer to use this stuff in a naive useless way, to verify.
	- ...

- Migrate all render configuration data to Renderer

- Simple scene-description format

- Propagation of ray differentials on bounces

- Adaptive sampling scheme

//- Create Transform class

- Simple material system (for testing purposes
  only, eventually replace with OSL)

- Refactor TimeBox template to use class methods for interpolation

- Multi-threaded rendering

- OSL integration

- More compact and/or faster BVH:
	- Quantized BVH?
	- MSBVH?
	- QBVH?
	- Quantized MSQBVH?  Ha ha ha.
